This project is unfinished and I am currently working on it

I am using chatgpts interface to connect the program which takes in a voice input and can interpret it to produce a text output the input also has behaviours and patterns it takes in. In order to allow it to have a more emotional response this needs more work done to it. It also interfaces with tp-link to control my room light
